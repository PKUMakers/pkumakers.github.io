NoteLink is a research project I led in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). The project is about digitalize annotation on printed document with out interfere with user's natrual way of handling the document. We have made a app with the same name. Provided with one shot of the annotated document, the app can automatically apply the annotation to the original document. Therefore, the user can enjoy the comfort of physical documents while experience the convenience of their digital counterparts.
