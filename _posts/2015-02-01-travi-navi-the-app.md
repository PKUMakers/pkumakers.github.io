Travi-Navi is a app that I participate in build at MSRA. It implement the algorithm mentioned at the Travi-Navi paper.

The Travi-Navi is indoor navgation app. The difference with other apps in the academia is that it can provide basic navgation functionality with little data. The app provide 2 roles for the user to choose, which are the guider and the follower. The guider provide trace for navgation while follower use them for navgation. We assume that shop, restaurant or estate owner will have the incentive to provide those traces inorder to attract more customer. The trace recorded by the guider is consist of basic sensor data, Wi-Fi signal list and some hint provided by the user on the go, such as photographs, text and audio message. When a follower follow the trace, the navgation system will automatically compose a approximate route by step count and direction from sensor data. On the follower's way to the destnation, the system will prompt message set by the guider when approprate. If user is defered from the course, the app will tell the user where is the last place on route the user has been on and ask user to return to the correct route.

The system provide a realistic incentive for user to provide indoor location related data to the system and provide a useful functionality with only little data provided.
