Bluewave is a context sharing framework. I have helped the project by building a few demo of the idea, including [accurate context sharing]() and [ThingKit]().

Bluewave is a lightweight but extensible technique that allows devices to opportunistically share context when they are nearby. With Bluewave, devices upload their context to the cloud, and modify their Bluetooth friendly name to contain a URL to this information. Other devices can then scan for these links and download the context without having to know of each other or pair in advance. Bluewave provides a simple way for users to share context through their mobile devices, which is useful for applications where the environment needs to collect information about the user.
